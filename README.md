The present-day [**coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic**](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) revolves around the uncontrolled spread of *severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2* (SARS-CoV-2). This coronavirus is a positive-strand RNA virus that causes severe respiratory syndrome in humans. Cryo-electron microscopy has demonstrated that viral entry is initiated by the binding of two viral trimeric spike proteins to the human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Yan et al., 2020). Under normal physiological conditions, ACE2 is responsible for the maturation of angiotensin, a peptide hormone that triggers the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone subsequently regulates vasoconstriction and blood pressure. When complexed with B<sup>0</sup>AT1, a neutral amino acid transporter, ACE2 forms a dimer that is targeted by SARS-CoV-2. This interaction provides a basis for the development of therapeutics that disrupt the function of SARS-CoV-2. For example, the development of ligands that bind ACE2 or the spike protein of coronavirus with enhanced affinity may present a potential means to interfere with viral infection. 

That being said, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected and killed thousands of people worldwide. In addition to pursuing drug treatments and vaccines targeting this virus, further measures must be taken to control its rapid dissemination. A major challenge to containing SARS-CoV-2 has been the significant number of undocumented infections. These undocumented infections have facilitated the movement of the virus across nations and overseas. Modeling of the unrestricted spread of SARS-CoV-2 through China in January 2020 by Li et al. (2020) showed that 86% of the infections went undocumented and that these infections were 55% as contagious as documented infections. Therefore, future containment of the virus requires an improved understanding of the true number of infected individuals so they may be isolated accordingly. 

In response to this challenge, Ferretti et al. (2020) admitted that SARS-CoV-2 is spreading too rapidly to be contained solely isolating symptomatic individuals and manually tracing their contacts. Rather, a faster, more efficient contact-tracing mobile phone App could be of benefit. This App would build a “memory” of proximity contacts and immediately notify contacts of positive cases. This would be particularly useful in scenarios where testing capacity is limited because individuals who are identified by tracing may be presumed positive upon the onset of symptoms due to their high probability of exposure. If the App is used by enough people in the correct manner alongside general preventative measures such as social distancing and sound hygienic practices, epidemics could be contained without a need for mass lock-downs that put the global society and economy on hold.
